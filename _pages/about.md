Thank you for visiting my website.

I'm a PhD candidate from [School of Risk and Actuarial Sciences](https://www.unsw.edu.au/business/our-schools/risk-actuarial), [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). My research interests are climate extremes, climate change and insurance, and systemic crises.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qihe Tang](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/qihe-tang), [Prof. Bernard Wong](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/bernard-wong), and [Prof. Andy Pitman](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-andy-pitman).
